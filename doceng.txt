           PATTERNS, PRACTICES, AND TOOLS FOR DOCUMENT ENGINEERING

                     SOURCE CODE VERSION CONTROL REPOSITORY
                     --------------------------------------

    docEng is a collection of practices, utilities and software components.
    The patterns are all around Document Engineering involving GitHub in
    some capacity.

    There is attention on how to structure for documentation of software
    projects.  There is attention on how to structure web-site organization
    for development and for documentation.  And there is attention to the
    processing of document representations in various forms.

    The determination and calibration of document-processing interop is a
    separate project, currently in hibernation: orcmid/DocInterop on GitHub.

    Document Engineering patterns are developed with implementations found
    in other GitHub projects.  The Document Engineerng application to docEng
    itself is a flavor of self-referential pattern.
