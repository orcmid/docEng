           PATTERNS, PRACTICES, AND TOOLS FOR DOCUMENT ENGINEERING

                     SOURCE CODE VERSION CONTROL REPOSITORY
                     --------------------------------------

    docEng is a collection of practices, utilities and software components.
    The patterns are all around Document Engineering involving GitHub in
    some capacity.

    There is attention on how to structure for documentation of software
    projects.  There is attention on how to structure web-site organization
    for development and for documentation.  And there is attention to the
    processing of document representations in various forms.

    The determination and calibration of document-processing interop is a
    separate project, currently in hibernation: orcmid/DocInterop on GitHub.

    Document Engineering patterns are developed with implementations found
    in other GitHub projects.  The Document Engineerng application to docEng
    itself is a flavor of self-referential pattern.

TODO

  * Fix .gitignore to ignore FrontPage artifacts in case they occur here.

  * Edit GitHub Readme.md to describe this project.

  * Explain what Document Engineering is.

  * Complete any customization of the front-porch of the project's repository:
    License
    Notice
    .gitignore
    .gitattributes

  * Start using orcmid/docEng Issues, Discussion, and Projects for operation
    in the open

  * CRITICAL QUESTION: Will we use the nfoCentrale Construction Structure and
    Construction Materials scheme here, and if so, how do we deal with
    conversations about other forms of docEng.  Reconcile this with the
    originally-intended scope for docEng.

  * Get into the GitHub templates for documentation and deal with it in the
    Construction Materials of the docEng site.  See
    <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues/8>.

  * The use of FrontPage for GitHub Pages is not the same as the site-server
    model.  There is no separation between authored and published.  With
    FrontPage over a GitHub Pages folder (e.g., a docs/) there is no sepaation
    of design-time and server publishing.  Design-time operations are
    immediately publised once committed to the GitHub projct.  I'm fine with
    that.  It just needs to be clear in how I speak about it.

  * Find a clean way to talk about the *authored" documentation and the
    *authoring" source that is published to be the documentation.  Need some
    nomenclature that I don't keep tripping over.  [from Miser Project]

  * The default rendering, with no template, provides reflow in the manner
    required for Miser Project documentation.  How to ensure that with any
    of the provided themes remains to be understood. [from Miser Project]

  * Find a theme that supports reflow.  The Pages templates do not seem to
    provide for that. [from Miser Project]

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works. [from
    Miser Project]

  * I am trusting that this material is current as of 2019-11-20:
    <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

   * I have been employing in-line HTML comments to account for versioning
     of markdown pages here.  I don't know if there is something better, using
     YAML or something. [from Miser Project]

   * Work through all of the feature cases of GitHub Markdown to see what
     works with the default template.  Use construction/test/ or example/
     for that.  [from Miser Project]

   * Create a test document (set) that demonstrates the main Markup
     provisions. [from Miser Project]

   * Create a folder (i.e., plain/ that carries captured images of the
     current test/demo document under the default template).  [from Miser
     Project]

   * Make a template for the index.md source pages. [from Miser Project]

   * Add a forensics folder on web-site and authoring, plus trouble-shooting,
     reverse-engineering, etc.  Maybe this belongs on docEng.
     [from Miser Project]

   * Confirm preservation with pre-HTML5 browsers, such as Internet Explorer.
     [from Miser Project]

   * The "improve this page" and edit/master link requires being logged-in to
     GitHub.  We need a way to suppress that.  [from Miser Project]

  * The folio system is a bit different here.  There can be a counterpart in
    how pages and their assets are in folders.  The idea of version sequences
    does not quite work unless we take it to a lower level.  The use of insert
    pages might have no counterpart here.  Having the effect would take
    copying. [now that FrongPage is being used, the design-time actions are
    now available.  The dealing with folio depth and URL-shortening is
    illustrated in nfoTools/tools.] [from Miser Project]

  * GitHub, and use of Git, provides a valuable history and provenance system.
    It requires access to such "document forensic" tools and doesn't support
    removed (? what phrase did I intend here) prints of pages the way I have
    desired.  I think this is about wanting to always have material be
    printable and having its provenance/origin be explicit in it.
    [from Miser Project]

  * I need docEng of the docEng/docs about docEng.  This seemingly recursive
    case needs to bottom out on some ground case.

  * With regard to web-published documentation, this seems to be the place
    for wingnut.  Or do I really need a wingnut project?  It certainly has
    its own blog(s), etc., but that does not prevent it from being under
    docEng.

  * On the other hand, it might make more sense to have nfoCentrale
    as a GitHub project, just like that web has been under VSS.  Must think
    this through.  Wingnut is about blogs and not web sites, but it is a
    portion of a larger project.  But there are individual webs under IIS
    in the nfoCentral publishing model, even though they map to subfolders
    on A2 Hosting's nfoCentrale.com site.  So they are managed individually
    and updates published individually.

  * The nfoCentrale publishing model does rely on the site-server model to
    distinguish between authoring (in FrontPage) and publishing (via FTP from
    shared VSS of final-form HTML and assets).

  * Do I really want to rescue nfoCentrale.com?  I should subdivide it then,
    and I should probably keep the projects private.

  * Can a project be published (under orcmid.github.io) even when the
    authoring repository is private?  I need to look into that.

  * Can I rescue an nfoCentrale.com web site into a Hugo site?  What will
    have to change?  COOL.  GitHub publishes .md files to .html, not .htm,
    so I can have my construction structures and other files side-by-side.

  * With regard to granularity, it is clear I should not have repositories
    larger than the domains that map to nfoCentrale.com.  I will not keep
    the separate domains (or at least not most of them), but I can make them
    separate GitHub projects and isolate the authoring.  Whether I publish
    to individual docs or into a larger one is a separate consideration.
    I am conflicted about that.  I don't want to think of GitHub having to
    republish large chunks or even an entire mega-doc folder.

  * I need to think through the nfoCentral federation of sites to a rescue
    and preservation on GitHub.

  * I also need to find a way to make headway on important nfoTools, Miser,
    and docEng efforts without getting badly detoured.

  * A goal for breaking the logjam, without floating all the logs at once,
    is employment of Hugo for orcmid.github.io/docEng itself and going on
    from there.  Hugo will come under tools/ and maybe dev/ here.  There also
    may need to be a wingnut preservation as demonstration of the rescue and
    also introduction of Hugo for it.

  * I assume that a repository that is specifically for a web site could have
    GitHub Pages be at the root.  It makes the README be a little weird,
    except it can serve as the front porch. I should try that.  I need to be
    careful about its maintenance as a Hugo site then.  Yes, that's weird.
    Obviously needs to be tried with wingnut and I need to get my head around
    this case.  I'm just attempting to save a level of nesting for a project
    that is entirely about a web site.

  * In this case, the clone is a Hugo publishing folder, not the Hugo
    authoring folder.  That breaches wanting to have the authoring be under
    Git.  I must adjust the model for that.  It looks like the Hugo site
    should be a project and its public should be the GitHub pages.  There is
    a small matter of customization of other aspects and how that syncs with
    Hugo updates.  These are customizations of dependencies.  I need to figure
    out how that can work.

  * This is complicated.  I have to figure out what not to clone yet I can
    customize and preserve in GitHub.  I don't think I should be using
    .gitmodule in this.  I then need to deal with dependency/customization
    management.  My head hurts and I will stop for now.

  * I need some simple rescue efforts in Hugo.

  * See docs.txt for more on skills and tools, including translation as well
    as exfiltration of web sites/content.

  * Here's a related/relevant skill item,
    <https://twitter.com/vardi/status/1523069742076022785>.

  * Internationalization (i18n) and accessibility (a11y) are particularly
    relevant in document engineering and applicable to docEng docs/.  There
    is a cross-over with nfotools/docs (cf.) and this needs to be navigated.
    Since we propose to use Hugo for document engineering of orcmid.github.io,
    that all needs to be sorted out.

  * Many nfoCentrale add-on domains are being retired and only replaced by
    their subdomains.  This is an interesting process and might be managed
    from here or orcmid.github.io/wingnut.  I am not clear about this.
