    nfoTools is a collection of utilities and software components.  The
    tools are designed for in the composition of larger software projects
    for information-processing applications.  They can apply anywhere in
    the complete learning-and-improvement lifecycle of software projects.

    While nfoTools are useful independently, they are chosen and developed
    in service of specific nfoWare.com and nfoWorks.org software efforts.
