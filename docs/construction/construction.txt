 TODO

   * Find a clean way to talk about the *authored" documentation and the
    *authoring" source that is published to be the documentation.  Need some
    nomenclature that I don't keep tripping over.

  * Identify adaptation of the infrastructure technique used on sites such
    as miser-theory or the nfoCentrale sites in general.  Find appropriate
    links.

  * Find a theme that supports reflow.  The Pages templates do not seem to
    provide for that.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * I am trusting that this material is current as of 2021-02-15:
    <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

  * The default rendering, with no template, provides reflow in the manner
    required for docEng Project documentation.  How to ensure that with any
    of the provided themes remains to be understood.

   * Determine how I can have some kind of versioning on my .md pages and
     have that part be private (not rendered).  It depends on the GitHub
     Markdown and maybe some YAML control.  Must find out about that.

   * Work through all of the feature cases of GitHub Markdown to see what
     works with the default template.  Use construction/test/ or example/
     for that.

   * Create a test document (set) that demonstrates the main Markup
     provisions.

   * Create a folder (i.e., plain/ that carries captured images of the
     current test/demo document under the default template)

   * Create a version of the text ruler for the markdown pages.

   * Make a template for the index.md source pages.

   * Maybe it is harmonious to call this the Construction Zone ?

   * Add a forensics folder on web-site and authoring, plus rouble-shooting,
     reverse-engineering, etc.

   * Could also introduce document-engineering in a sub-folder also.

   * Confirm preservation with pre-HTML5 browsers, such as Internet Explorer.

   * The "improve this page" and edit/master link requires being logged-in to
     GitHub.  We need a way to suppress that.  Document this in "plain."

  * The folio system is a bit different here.  There can be a counterpart in
    how pages and their assets are in folders.  The idea of version sequences
    does not quite work unless we take it to a lower level.  The use of insert
    pages might have no counterpart here.  Having the effect would take
    copying.

  * GitHub, and use of Git, provides a valuable history and provenance system.
    It requires access to such "document forensic" tools and doesn't support
    removed prints of pages the way I have desired.

  * The missing here is construction zones and also the job jar xyymmnna.htm
    pages.  At the moment, construction structure is in the <folder>.txt files
    like this one.  The Construction Material folder is now equivalent to the
    Construction Zone scheme on nfoCentrale.

  * Repair the substructure and content of construction/ to reside directly at
    docs/construction/ and https://orcmid.github.io/miser/construction.

 0.0.0 2021-02-16T00:36Z Create placeholder and initial job jar for docEng
       Project documentation authoring "about/construction/", morphing the
       same page of the Miser Project.  All that experimentation with the
       GitHub (default) templates and others is moved for continuation here.
