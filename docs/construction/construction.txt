 TODO
  * Bring the nfoCentral construction structure here.  Continue the current/
    and plain/ experiments being around Markdown.  These will not longer be
    supported on the Miser Project although the handling of LaTex formulas
    and other purposes in logic and mathematics will matter here.

  * Find a clean way to talk about the *authored" documentation and the
    "authoring" source that is published to be the documentation.  Need some
    nomenclature that I don't keep tripping over.

  * Identify adaptation of the infrastructure technique used on sites such
    as miser-theory or the nfoCentrale sites in general.  Find appropriate
    links.

  * Find a theme that supports reflow.  The Pages templates do not seem to
    provide for that. The no-template default does support reflow.  How to
    ensure that with any of the provided themes remains to be understood.

  * If a theme is customized, determine where and how that works.

  * I am trusting that this material is current as of 2021-02-15:
    <https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages>

   * HTML comments can be used in Markdown pages to provide for the ruler and
     also versioning.  This is being practiced now on nfoTools and elsewhere.

   * Work through all of the feature cases of GitHub Markdown to see what
     works with the default template.  Use construction/test/ or example/
     for that.

   * Create a test document (set) that demonstrates the main Markup
     provisions.

   * Make a template for the index.md source pages.

   * Add a forensics folder on web-site and authoring, plus trouble-shooting,
     reverse-engineering, etc.

   * Confirm preservation with pre-HTML5 browsers, such as Internet Explorer.

   * The "improve this page" and edit/master link requires being logged-in to
     GitHub.  We need a way to suppress that.  Document this in "plain."

  * The TROSTing folio system is a bit different here.  There can be a
    counterpart in how pages and their assets are in folders.  The use of
    insert pages might have no counterpart here.  Having the effect would take
    copying.

  * GitHub, and use of Git, provides a valuable history and provenance system.
    It requires access to such "document forensic" tools and doesn't support
    removed prints of pages the way I have desired.

  * The missing here is construction zones and also the job jar xyymmnna.htm
    pages.  At the moment, construction structure is in the <folder>.txt files
    like this one.  The Construction Material folder is now equivalent to the
    Construction Zone scheme on nfoCentrale.

  * Repair the substructure and content of construction/ to reside directly at
    docs/construction/ and <https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/construction>.

  * Add attribution

  * Add a folder for dealing with github.io characteristics as they influence
    organization of pages here.  The experimental determinations provide
    information that informs other GitHub Pages employment for other projects.

  * Adjust for the prospect of using a framework that publishes from Markdown
    to hypertext pages, with docs/ used as the mirror that GitHub publishes
    from.  This is a counterpart of the site-server model that was behind all
    of the nfoCentrale.com sites.

  * Hugo and the Hugo docs template appears to provide the control I want for
    authoring my own material and should be a topic as a docEng case.

  * This Construction Zone is about the construction of the docEng site,
    <https://orcmid.github.io/docEng>.  I did not anticipate having folio
    structure here.  I am unclear why.  If I want to do forensics on GitHub
    Pages, I could use a folio structure rather than more named subfolders.
    Why am I resisting? [2023-11-16: The ability to use FrontPage changes
    my attitude about all of this.]

*---|----1----|----2----|----3----|----4----|----5----|----6----|----7----|--*

 0.0.3 2023-11-16T21:19Z Reflect possibility of FrontPage cases.
 0.0.2 2022-10-13T16:05Z Manage TODOs, clarify what this Construction Zone is.
 0.0.1 2021-10-29T21:58Z Smooth, change "master" to "main," add rulers
 0.0.0 2021-02-16T00:36Z Create placeholder and initial job jar for docEng
       Project documentation authoring "about/construction/", morphing the
       same page of the Miser Project.  All that experimentation with the
       GitHub (default) templates and others is moved for continuation here.
