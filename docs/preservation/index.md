Depending on the purpose for a Document Engineering activity, an important
element is how materials will be preserved and even memorialized in the face
of future contingencies.

* What arrangements are made to endure changes in
technology and participation of contributors?

* What provisions protect against
loss of the authored materials and their presentation in the face of altered
relationships and breakdowns in services and products?

* What allows for
repurposing of materials and transformation to new purposes and development
regimes?

There is no magic bullet to ensure successful answers to these questions.
However, there is enough material in the orbit of the docEng project to
provide case studies and practical demonstrations.

The fundamental requirement for a preservable document-engineering result is
anticipation and practical commitment.  There needs to be consistency and
avenues to recovery/transposition of created works for their endurance and
even active continuation.  In the absence of attention to preservation,
document-engineering projects will be subject to
short-attention-span theatre and accompanying bit rot.

The use of GitHub and GitHub Pages is an opportunity for preservation,
considering the expected longevity of Git and of the immense GitHub operation.
How one obtains a preservable web presence to authoring/documentation
projects is a matter to be addressed in the context of docEng on GitHub.

It is also the case that GitHub and GitHub Pages are being used **for**
preservation of materials originally created elsewhere and that are amenable
to preservation/forking/continuation here.  That is already happening in the
[nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools) and
[Miser Project](https://orcmid.github.io/miser) efforts using GitHub project
repositories.
