                 ------------------------------------------

    Documentation of preservation activities is housed here.  A major
    initial effort is preservation of subsites of nfoCentrale.com as the
    related domain names are retired.  There will be related activities
    for other kinds of preservation.

 TODO

   * First address preservation of a site maintained with the site-server
     model as a GitHub pages transposition.

  * Rescuing and retargeting web sites is also a thing.  I am doing that with
    the Site Builder scheme for nfoCentrale, exfiltrating wingnut, Orcmid's
    Lair, Miser, and nfoCentrale at least, along with nfo stuff.

  * Use the nfoTools default GitHub markdown treatment for folio structures,
    then consider an alternative authoring that involves direct HTML creation
    (e.g., via FrontPage) and then via a Markdown authored alternative.  This
    is about the preservability of the docEng documentation itself, and the
    means of transposition through various "framework" efforts.

  * Consider preservation of the nfoCentral common construction/ materials
    as a seed construction/ for docEng.  This gets a bit too recursive and
    I have to figure out where to pinch things off.

  * The scaffolding model goes back to the Software Engineering team project
    when I was studying for an M.Sc in Information Technology through an
    on-line program conducted by the University of Liverpool.

  * I need to preserve my "What's an Orcmid" page and the related one on the
    M.Sc in IT effort.  I need to also add something on how much the courses
    reminded me of how much I had already learned and absorbed over the course
    of my career in software development.

  * I need to update my LinkedIn profile to be retired.  I need to preserve it
    somewhere too.  It is not so much docEng as github.com/orcmid.  Maybe that
    will be https://orcmid.github.io with no subfolder.  Check it out.  There
    is a page there.  I need to see how that works, including remembering how
    I created it.
