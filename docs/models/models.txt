                        DOCENG MODELS DOCUMENTATION
                        ---------------------------

    Documentation of docEng models is published here as GutHub Pages (so
    itself provided in one of the models to be described).  This scaffolding
    page is also here as passive but reachable content.

    There is an intersection of 2-3 models in this instance.  There's the
    construction structure scaffolding variation on the nfoCentrale site-
    server model, there's the code project scaffolding that this page is
    directly borrowed from, and there's any additional framework staging
    model that may come into play.  All to capture material on document
    engineering itself.

    This scaffolding, and further arrangements are an aspect of document
    engineering applied to the docEng project and site themselves.

 TODO

  * Add an index.md page as a placeholder about models.  Use any of the models
    to do that.

  * Rescuing and retargeting web sites is also a thing.  I am doing that with
    the Site Builder scheme for nfoCentrale, exfiltrating wingnut, Orcmid's
    Lair, Miser, and nfoCentrale at least, along with nfo stuff.

  * There's the site-builder model to describe.

  * There's the nfoCentrale model as well.  It is a variant of site-builder/
    -server model that uses a scaffolding structure.  It is the scaffolding
    that I want to capture, because a version of it is used in text files of
    GitHub repository folders.  This models.txt page is exemplary.
