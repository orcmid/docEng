# The docEng Project on GitHub

This space is under construction.  This page will become the home page for
The docEng Project documentation on GitHub.  One aspect of the Document
Engineering is that the site is always published and must be ready for
publication on any check-in pushed to the project repository.  Words in the
open is practiced here, along with having any code in the open.

The effort is a form of solo document engineering at this point.

## Axe Sharpening

This is an experimental employment of GitHub Pages at `master/docs/` to see
whether the documentation and blogging needs of the project can be met here
with minimal fuss.  That activity is documented here.

The published form of the pages is at <https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/>

Notes on the plumbing within the structure are found at pages such as
[docs.txt](docs.txt).  Such text pages are moved intact to the published
form.

The footer, offering page improvement (and presumably requiring a push
request) is maybe not what I had in mind.  It requires logging into GitHub.

An important feature of the default (i.e., none-specified) theme is that
reflow on change of browser view width is automatic and as desired.

I do have some concerns about explicit versioning and having content that
is skipped.  I can specify HTML comments for that, and I am doing so.

We will run through all of the Markdown options to see how they are
rendered here.  Theme demos provide a nice comparison.

Demonstration of the current theme, including the markdown elements, is
at [current](construction/current/) here.
