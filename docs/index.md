# Patterns, Practices, and Tools for Document Engineering

This space is under construction.  This page will become the home page for
The docEng Project documentation on GitHub.  One aspect of document
engineering for docEng itself is having the site always ready for
publication on any check-in pushed to the project repository.  Words in the
open is practiced here, along with having any code in the open.

The docEng project is a form of solo document engineering at this point.
It is a bit of Document Engineering about Document Engineering.

Focus is on the ways that GitHub can be used for document
authoring and (web) publication in useful ways, even though writing Markdown
pages and collaboration via GitHub may be rather alien to folks who just want
to author technical documents.  We need to look at the friction of that and
alternatives that may be improvements.

## Axe Sharpening

This is an experimental employment of GitHub Pages to see
whether the documentation and blogging needs of projects can be met here
with minimal fuss.  That activity is documented here.

An additional activity of some importance to this author is using GitHub
as a means of preservation and continuation of some web sites that were under
different publishing models.

The published form of this material is at <https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/>

Notes on the plumbing within the structure are found at pages such as
[docs.txt](docs.txt).  Such text pages are moved intact to the published
web location and can be accessed by the curious.

The footer, offering page improvement (and presumably requiring a push
request) is maybe not what I had in mind.  It requires logging into GitHub.

An important feature of the default (i.e., none-specified) theme is that
reflow on change of browser view width is automatic and as desired.

Demonstration of the current theme, including the markdown elements, is
at [current](construction/current/) here.

## docEng Table of Content

The docEng web is organized in topical sections.

| **Section** |  **General Topic** |
|   --:       |  ---               |
| others | watch this space |
| [preservation](preservation/) | Approaches to preservation/forking of web documentation sites |

| [construction](construction/) | docEng Web Construction Materials |

There will be links to related material and resources.

I invite discussion about docEng topics in the
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/docEng/discussions).
Improvements and removal of defects in this particular documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/docEng/issues).  There are also
relevant [projects](https://github.com/orcmid/docEng/projects?type=classic)
from time to time.
