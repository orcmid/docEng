                   DOCENG DOCUMENTATION SOURCE CODE FOLDER
                   ---------------------------------------

    Documentation of docEng tools and approaches is provided here as the
    source of GitHub Pages that are automatically published to
    <https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/>.  This scaffolding page is also
    published there.

    This scaffolding, and further arrangements are a case of document
    engineering applied to the docEng project and site themselves.

TODO

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.

  * Figure out what to do about Jekyll and its templates.

  * Find another way if there can be one.  MathJax is not crucial here, but
    other theming is desirable.

  * Inspect the Miser Project handling of docs/ for abstraction of a model.

  * Add attribution boilerplate here, establishing good footing.

  * Add Apache license and notices page ??  - It goes with the project, what
    about the site?
