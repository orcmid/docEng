    This scaffolding, and further arrangements are a case of document
    engineering applied to the docEng project and site themselves.

 TODO

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.

  * Figure out what to do about Jekyll and its templates.

  * Find another way if there can be one.  MathJax is not crucial here, but
    other theming is desirable.

  * Add Apache license and notices page ??  - It goes with the project, what
    about the site?
