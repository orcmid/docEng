                   DOCENG DOCUMENTATION SOURCE CODE FOLDER
                   ---------------------------------------

    Documentation of docEng tools and approaches is provided here as the
    source of GitHub Pages for automatic publishing to
    <https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/>.  This scaffolding page is also
    published there as passive but reachable content.

    This scaffolding, and further arrangements are a case of document
    engineering applied to the docEng project and site themselves.

 TODO

  * This will be the publication staging folder when publication is handled
    by generation under a framework such as Hugo.  The extra stage is to
    allow review at the authoring location so only publish-ready material is
    brought here when the time comes.

  * This is one of the pages that is part of the authoring structure too, so
    we need to confirm that and also deal with it in the location information.

  * This is a variation on the site-server model.  Document that in the
    preservation topic.

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.

  * I am not going to use jekyll or use docs/ as framework pages.  I will use
    docs/ as a publishing place for the static materials that are published to
    orcmid.github.io/docEng but not authored here.  Authoring is elsewhere so
    there can be review, etc., before committing here.

  * The staging publishing place would be moved here to docs/ from another
    "publish/public" location that might be copied over a clone location of
    the GitHub orcmid/docEng/docs folder.

  * I am going to explore hugo and the hugo-books template with KaTeX support.

  * Add Apache license and notices page ?? .  They apply to the docEng repo,
    what about the pages published here at docs/ ?

  * Figure out how to deal with the handling of Hugo frameworks in this
    context.  I want to experiment first.  How will that work exactly.

  * I have not completed the About and Construction stuff on how the default
    docs/ publishing template works.  I do need to handle that.  Also, if
    I branch off into trying a framework, I have to contend with that case
    also.

  * I really want to have a sandbox for trying different web-site frameworks
    and generation methods.  I have added wingnut to GitHub.  This might be
    the safest thing.  Kept in a separate project so I can
    migrate it different ways and have it all work.  I think what I did in
    the hexo case should be long forgotten though.

  * I can attempt to preserve Spanner Wingnut here also.  That would be an
    useful case of the overall methodology.

  * Add Hugo under tools and handle the establishment and use of Hugo and
    templates.

  * If there is a dev for this Hugo-authored structure, it might be about the
    publishing in Hugo format.

  * It is tricky here between this site being in a particular Hugo
    templated and it being something else.  So the native or plain case needs
    to be handled also.

  * Complete the current construction structure and the about and then also
    use the construction folder to document the framework(s) used.

  * Translation is a Skill and also Tools here.  I don't know that it applies
    in nfoTools, although it certainly might on behalf of i18n. And
    accessibility (a11y). We will see.

  * There is a good article about translations using Microsoft Office at
    <https://www.computerworld.com/article/3658212/how-to-translate-emails-documents-and-more-with-microsoft-office.html>
    Provide a link to that.  It is not quite accurate in terms of settings,
    but translation shows up as a feature (e.g., in Word) once the proofing
    tools are installed.  (Not certain this is necessary.  Must try another
    language to see.)

  * Rescuing and retargeting web sites is also a thing.  I am doing that with
    the Site Builder scheme for nfoCentrale, exfiltrating wingnut, Orcmid's
    Lair, Miser, and nfoCentrale at least, along with nfo stuff.
