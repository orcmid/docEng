                   ---------------------------------------

    Documentation of docEng tools and approaches is provided here as the
    source of GitHub Pages for automatic publishing to
    <https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/>.  This scaffolding page is also
    published there as passive but reachable content.

    This scaffolding, and further arrangements are a case of document
    engineering applied to the docEng project and site themselves.

 TODO

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.

  * Figure out what to do about Jekyll and its templates.

  * Find another way if there can be one.  MathJax is not crucial here, but
    other theming is desirable.

  * Add Apache license and notices page ??  - It goes with the project, what
    about the site?

  * Figure out how to deal with the handling of Hugo frameworks in this
    context.  I want to experiment first.  How will that work exactly.

  * I have not completed the About and Construction stuff on how the default
    docs/ publishing template works.  I do need to handle that.  Also, if
    I branch off into trying a framework, I have to contend with that case
    also.

  * I really want to have a sandbox for trying different web-site frameworks
    and generation methods.  Maybe I need to move spanner wingnut to GitHub?
    This might be the safest thing.  Put it in a separate project so I can
    migrate it different ways and have it all work.  I can also look at what
    I did in the hexo case, and with the test files for hexo cases.

  * This is hurting my head.
