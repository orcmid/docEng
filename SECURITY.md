**2024-09-22 Status**: The docEng project/repository is devoted to document
engineering models and templates, primarily for the use on
GitHub Pages.  All materials are provided in text files, static HTML files,
and Markdown using the default GitHub publisher for GitHub Pages.  There is no
anticipated need for security provisions and vulnerability consideration.

Comments are welcome under the project Issues and Discussion topics.
Pull-requests are unwarranted.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please confine vulnerability reporting to Orcmid on GitHub projects that have supported releases.

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface
that pertains to docEng, however unlikely, use the GitHub vulnerability
reporting provision of the
[Adv10 Security](https://github.com/orcmid/docEng/security) tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email
communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

Finally, if you wish encrypted responses, sign that message before
encryption in order for your public key to be available for that purpose.
