# Security Policy

**2024-09-09 Status**: The docEng project/repository is devoted to document engineering models and templates, primarily for the use on
GitHub Pages.  All materials are provided in text files, static HTML files, and Markdown using the default GitHub publisher for
GitHub Pages.  There is no anticipated need for security provisions and vulnerability consideration.  

Comments are welcome under the project Issues and Discussion topics.  Pull-requests are unwarranted.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please confine vulnerability reporting to Orcmid on GitHub projects that have supported releases.  If you believe there is still need to engage in
private discussion about a potential threat or threat-surface defect here on docEng, please use the GitHub
vulerability reporting provision of this project's Security tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to 
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have additional concerns about email security/privacy, put your message in an ASCII-armored PGP-encrypted enclosure using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc) public key.
